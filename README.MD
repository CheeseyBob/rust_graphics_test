## To-do:
- Multi-threading!
    - Implement a custom variant of Mutex which guards a Vec/array by index.
- Refactor Color so that the internal representation is u32 and test for potential performance increase.
- Refactor Location so that the internal representation is a usize and test for potential performance increase.
